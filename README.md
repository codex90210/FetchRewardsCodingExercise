# FetchRewardsCodingExercise

Hello My Name is David Mompoint, 

Welcome to My Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise Documentation!

This coding exercise utilizes SeatGeek API. This exercise shows how users are able to search for an event, select one from a table cell, like and unlike an event, 
and being able to view the date and location where avaible.

I've included an error alert message to handle latency in the API Request as a temporary work around solution. So if the initial page doesn't load the user has the 
ability to refresh the page and the views will reload accordingly.

In order to test and run the applicaiton you can sign up for the API ID and Secret key here -> https://seatgeek.com/build 

The API ID can be insterted to the idAPI constant and the Secret Key can be insterted in the sKey constant in the seatGeekAPIManager.swift file.

The project utilize core data for tracking like statuses across the application where users are able to quit the application and return with their liked status still
intacted per event.

I've implemented a filteration function where users can type in their desiered event and the table will automatically update as they type.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me anytime. 

Thank you for your consideration, 

David M.
